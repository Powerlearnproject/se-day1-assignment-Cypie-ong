Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the use of engineering tools to create softwares and solve problems associated with it and it plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The advent of structured programming in the 1960's ,it improved code readability and maintainability.
The emergence of object oriented programming in 1980's ,it facilitated better organisation of codes and reuse of components leading to a more managable software practices.
The agile movement in the 2000's ,improved flexilibilty and efficiency of software development and to align better with the user needs and evolving requirements 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement gathering and analysis .know and document the needs and requirements from stakeholders to define what the software should entail
System design creating a detailed design based on the requirements given by the stakeholder 
Implementation writing the code based on the design specifications 
Testing ,ensuring that whatever that is created meets the expectations and is fully functional without any problems 
Deployment .releasinf the software created to be used 
Maintenance and support .providing support ,fixing bugs and any other issues that may arise and also do updates on the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile methodology is flexible and efficient and can be altered to align with the user needs and it is dynamic while waterfall is a step by step process that requires one to finish one part before going to the next one .waterfall is easy to undrestand and predictable while agile is unpredictable and requires commitment
agile can be used in temas where people are collaborative while waterfall can be used in projects that require frequent changes


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer .creates webs and softwares ,fixes bugs and ensures whatever they create is working .
quality assurance engineer ensures that everything created meets the requirements and working according to the design created 
project manager ensures that everything is going on accordging to plan and people are collaborating and ensuring that things are done on time .

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs enhance productivity and error detection and ensurering project management.VCS ensure tracking of changes ,management and collaboration and providing essential features for code versioning and team coordination .Examples are git and visual studio 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges
Team collaboration.effective communication with team members 
Testing and debugging 
security challenges .develop strong systems that do not easily fail
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing helps identifying issues eraly in the development process .making it easy to fix bugs at lower costs.
Intergration testing detects defects and issues that may arise when different modules are inrtgrated.
System testing ,validates the functionality of the software and that it meets the requirements and is working as excpected
Acceptance ensures it meets user needs and that the product is acceptable for delivery .

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is creating prompts to interact with AI models 
Enhance quality and reduces misinterpretation and improving efficiency and ensure that the answers provided are clear and specific

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vagues prompts lack clarity and do not give context e.g tell me the history of kenya . improved prompt will be "tell me about the events that happened in kenya during the year 1960 and provide details of the events ".
improved prompts are more effective because they provide the exact answers according to the prompt ,it is clear and specific.
